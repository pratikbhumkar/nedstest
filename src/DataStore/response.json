Comes through a good form race. Can make it back to back wins. WALSH (5) turned spotting a big start finishing seventh (26.43) last time in a Grade 4/5 at Ipswich. Solid record here winning three races. Rates a leading chance on best. KERMADEC (6) showed little early speed at his last couple, the latest finishing eighth (22.85) in a Grade 5 at Maitland. In the mix on best form. MAYWYN ONYX (3) can improve on an unplaced run here last time out.",
